## Reproducibility
The current release and master is a refactored version of the code used for the paper. 
This refactored version produces the same number as reported in the paper, but if you
wish to use the exact code used in the paper, please continue [here](scripts/reproducibility/README.md).

Further results (qualitative and quantitative) can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/juglab/DenoiSeg/wiki).
